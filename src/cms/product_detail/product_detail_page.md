        CH. The PF type, optimized for Plasma Fractionation, delivers even lower
        endotoxin values, ensuring superior performance. At the same time, the
        beta-glucan value is also very low. The type ZP is characterized by a
        zeta-potential in addition to the purity usual for the entire PURAFIX
